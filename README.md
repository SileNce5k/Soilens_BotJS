# discord_bot

A modular discord bot written in javascript, using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library.

This is my second attempt at making a discord bot.

---

To use the bot:

```text
git clone https://github.com/SileNce5k/discord_bot.git
cd discord_bot
npm install
node server.js
```

The first time you start the bot with `node server.js`, it will create a directory called data with a config.json file.  
In this file, enter your bot token.  
You can also enter a login message, channel and enable it.  
You can also change the global prefix.  
Every time you want to change something in this file, you have to restart the bot.
